This repository contains the codebase for publicly hosting my personal notes.

Direct any comments/suggestions/corrections to the content of the site to an appropriate Issue/PR to my [ ZettelKasten notes repository ](https://github.com/jerivl/zk) which is pulled as a submodule to the repo.

Based on [ Perlite ](https://github.com/secure-77/Perlite), an open-source web-based markdown viewer for Obsidian.
